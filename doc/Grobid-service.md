# GROBID Service API

The GROBID Web API provides a simple and efficient way to use the tool. A service console is available to test GROBID in a human friendly manner. For production and benchmarking, we strongly recommend to use this web service mode on a multi-core machine and to avoid running GROBID in the batch mode.

## Start the server with Docker

This is the recommended and standard way to run the Grobid web services, see [here](getting_started.md).

## Start a development server with Gradle

Go under the `grobid/` main directory. Be sure that the GROBID project is built, see [Install GROBID](Install-Grobid.md).

The following command will start the server on the default port __8070__:

```console
./gradlew run
```

(the Gradle process will hang at something like 88%, this is normal because the web service is ran sharing the same JVM as Gradle)

## Install and run the service as standalone application

From a development installation, you can also build and install the service as a standalone service - here let's supposed the destination directory is grobid-installation:

```console
./gradlew clean assemble
cd ..
mkdir grobid-installation
cd grobid-installation
unzip ../grobid/grobid-service/build/distributions/grobid-service-0.9.0.zip
mv grobid-service-0.9.0 grobid-service
unzip ../grobid/grobid-home/build/distributions/grobid-home-0.9.0.zip
./grobid-service/bin/grobid-service
```

The directory `grobid-installation` should have the following structure:

```text
.
├── grobid-home
└── grobid-service
```

## Service checks

You can check whether the service is up and running by opening the following URL:

* <http://yourhost:8070/api/version> will return you the current version and the revision of the running service. The revision is obtained via `git describe --tags --always --first-parent` and follows the format `<tag>-<N>-g<hash>` (e.g. `0.9.0-70-g94429f4e2` meaning 70 commits after tag 0.9.0, at commit `94429f4e2`). In the web console, the revision links to the corresponding commit on GitHub.
* <http://yourhost:8070/api/isalive> **(liveness)** returns `true`/`false` as plain text indicating whether the service completed initialization successfully. Returns HTTP 200 when alive, HTTP 503 when not initialized or initialization failed. Suitable for use as a liveness probe in container orchestrators (Docker, Kubernetes).
* <http://yourhost:8070/api/health> **(readiness)** returns a JSON object with detailed status including initialization state, engine pool metrics (active/idle/max engines), and configuration checks. Returns HTTP 200 when ready to process requests, HTTP 503 otherwise. Suitable for use as a readiness probe.

The service provides also an admin console, reachable at <http://yourhost:8071> where some additional checks like ping, metrics, hearthbeat are available.
We recommend, in particular to have a look at the metrics (using the [Metric library](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.1.0/getting-started/)) which are providing the rate of execution as well as the throughput of each entry point.

In addition, metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) exposition format are available at <http://yourhost:8071/metrics/prometheus>. This includes both the application metrics (rate/throughput per entry point) and JVM/process metrics (heap, GC, threads, CPU). A Prometheus server can scrape this endpoint and the metrics can then be visualised and alerted on in [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). See [Monitoring with Prometheus](Monitoring.md) for a step-by-step setup.  

## Configure the server

If required, modify the file under `grobid/grobid-home/config/grobid.yaml` for starting the server on a different port or if you need to change the absolute path to your `grobid-home` (e.g. when running on production). By default `grobid-home` is located under `grobid/grobid-home`. `grobid-home` contains all the models and static resources required to run GROBID.

See the [configuration page](Configuration.md) for details on how to set the different parameters of the `grobid.yaml` configuration file. Service and logging parameters are also set in this configuration file.

If Docker is used, see [here](Grobid-docker.md#configure-using-the-yaml-config-file) on how to start a Grobid container with a modified configuration file.

### Model loading strategy
You can choose to load all the models at the start of the service or lazily when a model is used the first time.
Preloading all the models at server start is the default setting. Loading all models at startup will slow down the start of the server and will use more memory than the lazy mode in case only a few services will be used. You can switch to lazy loading of the model:

```yaml
grobid:
  # for **service only**: how to load the models,
  # false -> models are loaded when needed, avoiding putting in memory useless models (only in case of CRF) but slow down
  #          significantly the service at first call
  # true -> all the models are loaded into memory at the server startup (default), slow the start of the services
  #         and models not used will take some more memory (only in case of CRF), but server is immediately warm and ready
  modelPreload: true
```

## Errors handling

The structure of errors is organised as follows:

| HTTP Status code  | reason                                                                                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200               | Successful operation.                                                                     |
| 204               | Process was completed, but no content could be extracted and structured                   |
| 400               | Wrong request, missing parameters, missing header                                         |
| 500               | Indicate an internal service error, further described by a provided message               |
| 503               | The service is not available, which usually means that all the threads are currently used |

However, there are some specific errors related to the processing that should be considered.
The following table provides the Grobid error codes, the related HTTPS error and a description and suggestion/explanation:

| Error Code                    | HTTP Status Code            | Description                                                                                         | Possible Cause / Suggested Action                                                          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BAD_INPUT_DATA`              | 500 (Internal Server Error) | The input data is not correct (e.g., unreadable or missing PDF).                                    | Check that the PDF is valid and supplied in the request.                                   |
| `NO_BLOCKS`                   | 500 (Internal Server Error) | The PDF contains no text blocks (likely a scanned document without OCR, only images).               | Ensure the PDF has selectable text; consider running OCR if it is image-only.              |
| `TOO_MANY_BLOCKS`             | 500 (Internal Server Error) | The PDF has too many text blocks; Grobid avoids processing very large documents for safety.         | Try splitting the document or processing fewer pages at a time.                            |
| `TOO_MANY_TOKENS`             | 500 (Internal Server Error) | The PDF contains too many tokens (words); Grobid avoids processing very large documents for safety. | Try splitting the document or processing fewer pages at a time.                            |
| `TIMEOUT`                     | 500 (Internal Server Error) | The PDF took too long to process and was stopped.                                                   | Try with a smaller or simpler document; check server resources.                            |
| `TAGGING_ERROR`               | 500 (Internal Server Error) | The DeLFT/CRF tagging process failed (model mismatch or tagging engine error).                      | Check model compatibility between grobid-home and grobid-core; verify model files.         |
| `PARSING_ERROR`               | 500 (Internal Server Error) | The PDF parsing process failed (XML parsing, vector graphics processing, or file structure issues). | Check PDF file integrity; verify XML structure; report with specific file and logs.        |
| `GENERAL`                     | 500 (Internal Server Error) | A general internal error occurred (possible bug in Grobid).                                         | Check logs for details; report the issue with relevant files and logs.                     |
| `PDFALTO_CONVERSION_FAILURE`  | 500 (Internal Server Error) | The PDF could not be converted by pdfalto (damaged file or pdfalto bug).                            | Try opening the PDF manually; if valid, report the issue with the file.                    |

!!! tip
    - "Blocks" refer to logical text regions detected in the PDF (e.g., paragraphs, headers).
    - "Tokens" refer to individual words or symbols.
    - "Tagging" refers to the process of assigning labels to tokens using statistical models.
    - When **reporting issues** related to the error of type `GENERAL`, please **provide as much detail as possible**, such as input PDF document, log files.

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Share)

By default, Grobid allows API access from any origin.
The configuration can be modified, for example to restrict origin, methods and header of access, through the YAML configuration file `grobid-home/config/grobid.yaml`:

```yaml
grobid:
  corsAllowedOrigins: "grobid.com"
  corsAllowedMethods: "OPTIONS,GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,HEAD"
  corsAllowedHeaders: "X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Accept,Origin"
```

## Clients for GROBID Web Services

We provide clients written in Python, Java, node.js using the GROBID PDF-to-TEI conversion Web services for parallel batch processing:

* <a href="https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid-client-python" target="_blank">Python GROBID client</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid-client-java" target="_blank">Java GROBID client</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid-client-node" target="_blank">Node.js GROBID client</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/miku/grobidclient" target="_blank">Go GROBID client</a> (third party)

All these clients will take advantage of the multi-threading for scaling PDF batch processing. As a consequence, they will be much more efficient than the [batch command lines](Grobid-batch.md) (which use only one thread) and should be preferred. The Python client is the more up-to-date and complete and can be adapted for your needs.

### Alternative output formats (Markdown and JSON)

The GROBID REST API produces [TEI XML](TEI-encoding-of-results.md) — a rich, loss-less representation of the extracted structure. For downstream use cases where TEI is inconvenient (feeding an LLM, building a search index, rendering a preview), the [Python GROBID client](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid-client-python) ships **optional** client-side converters that transform the TEI response into simpler formats:

* **Markdown** — a flat, human-readable rendering of the document body with headings, paragraphs, lists, and inline references. Useful for feeding extracted content into language models or Markdown-based documentation tools.
* **JSON** — a lossy, structured representation inspired by the [CORD-19](https://github.com/allenai/cord19) schema, with separate sections for bibliographic metadata, body text, figures and tables, and references. Useful for downstream indexing, analytics, or feeding structured data into other tools.

!!! note "These formats are optional — TEI remains the source of truth"
    The converters run **on the client side**, after the TEI response has been received from the GROBID server. The server itself always returns TEI XML; the Python client then optionally projects it into Markdown or JSON if you ask it to. Both formats are lossy compared to the full TEI output — in particular, fine-grained layout information, coordinates, and some bibliographic metadata are simplified or dropped. If you need the complete structure, stick with TEI.

See the [grobid-client-python README](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid-client-python) for the exact options to enable Markdown or JSON output when calling the client.

## Use GROBID test console

On your browser, the welcome page of the service console is available at the URL <http://localhost:8070>.

On the service console, the REST API can be tested under the `TEI` tab for service returning a TEI document, under the `PDF` tab for services returning annotations relative to PDF or an annotated PDF and under the `Patent` tab for patent-related services:

![Example of GROBID Service console usage](img/grobid-rest-example.png)

The services returning JSON results for dynamic PDF annotation purposes can be tested under the `PDF` tab. The PDF is rendered with [PDF.js] and the console javascript offers a reference implementation on how to use the returned annotations with coordinates for web application,

![Example of GROBID PDF.js annotation](img/popup.png)

Still to demonstrate [PDF.js] annotation possibilities, by default bibliographical reference for which a DOI (or arXiv ID) is extracted or found by consolidation are made clickable on the original rendered PDF:

![Example of GROBID PDF.js clickable annotation based on extraction results](img/doi-link.png)

## GROBID Web Services

We describe below the provided resources corresponding to the HTTP verbs, to use the grobid web services. All url described below are relative path, the root url is `http://<server instance name>/<root context>`

The consolidation parameters (`consolidateHeader`, `consolidateCitations`, `consolidateFunders`) indicate if GROBID should try to complete the extracted metadata with an additional external call to [CrossRef API](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc) or [biblio-glutton](https://github.com/kermitt2/biblio-glutton). The CrossRef and biblio-glutton look-up are realized based on the reliable subset of extracted metadata which are supported by these API. Each consolidation parameter is a string which can have three values:

* `0`, means no consolidation at all is performed: all the metadata will come from the source PDF
* `1`, means consolidation against CrossRef/biblio-glutton and update of metadata: when we have a DOI match, the publisher metadata are combined with the metadata extracted from the PDF, possibly correcting them
* `2`, means consolidation against CrossRef/biblio-glutton and, if matching, addition of the DOI only

The consolidation for header can use a fourth value (`3`), restricting the consolidation to the usage of DOI only, if a DOI has been extracted in the header section.

### PDF to TEI conversion services

#### /api/processHeaderDocument

Extract the header of the input PDF document, normalize it and convert it into a TEI XML or [BibTeX] format.

`consolidateHeader` is a string of value `0` (no consolidation), `1` (consolidate and inject all extra metadata, default value), `2` (consolidate the header metadata and inject DOI only) or `3` (consolidate using only extracted DOI, if extracted, and do not try to consolidate using any other metadata).

Only meaningful when `debugMode` is enabled. The pipeline still runs in full; this only filters the response. Unknown model names yield `400`. |


Use `Accept: application/x-bibtex` to retrieve BibTeX format instead of XML TEI.

However, please bear in mind that the TEI XML format is much richer and structured, it should be preferred if there is no particular reason to use BibTeX, so we recommend to always use `Accept: application/xml`.

Response status codes:

| HTTP Status code  | reason                                                                                    |

| 503               | The service is not available, which usually means that all the threads are currently used |

A `503` error with the default parallel mode normally means that all the threads available to GROBID are currently used. The client need to re-send the query after a wait time that will allow the server to free some threads. The wait time depends on the service and the capacities of the server, we suggest 2 seconds for the `processHeaderDocument` service.

You can test this service with the **cURL** command lines, for instance header extraction from a PDF file in the current directory:

```console
curl -v -H "Accept: application/xml" --form input=@./thefile.pdf localhost:8070/api/processHeaderDocument
```

If you want a simpler result in the BibTeX format:

```console
curl -v -H "Accept: application/x-bibtex" --form input=@./thefile.pdf localhost:8070/api/processHeaderDocument
```

#### /api/processFulltextDocument

Convert the complete input document into TEI XML format (header, body and bibliographical section).

A `503` error with the default parallel mode normally means that all the threads available to GROBID are currently used. The client need to re-send the query after a wait time that will allow the server to free some threads. The wait time depends on the service and the capacities of the server, we suggest 5-10 seconds for the `processFulltextDocument` service.

The optional sentence segmentation in the TEI XML result is based on the algorithm selected in the Grobid configuration file (under `grobid-home/config/grobid.yaml`). As of August 2020, available segmenters are [OpenNLP sentence detector](https://opennlp.apache.org/docs/1.5.3/manual/opennlp.html#tools.sentdetect) (recommended for scientific articles after evaluation) and the [Pragmatic_Segmenter](https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter).

You can test this service with the **cURL** command lines, for instance fulltext extraction (header, body and citations) from a PDF file in the current directory:

```console
curl -v --form input=@./thefile.pdf localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument
```

fulltext extraction and add coordinates to the figures (and tables) only:

```console
curl -v --form input=@./12248_2011_Article_9260.pdf --form teiCoordinates=figure --form teiCoordinates=biblStruct localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument
```

fulltext extraction and add coordinates for all the supported coordinate elements (sorry for the ugly cURL syntax on this, but that's how cURL is working!):

```console
curl -v --form input=@./12248_2011_Article_9260.pdf --form teiCoordinates=persName --form teiCoordinates=figure --form teiCoordinates=ref --form teiCoordinates=biblStruct --form teiCoordinates=formula localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument
```

Regarding the bibliographical references, it is possible to include the original raw reference string in the parsed bibliographical result with the parameter `includeRawCitations` set to `1`:

```console
curl -v --form input=@./thefile.pdf --form includeRawCitations=1 localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument
```

Similar raw strings can be added in the result for affiliation and copyrights/license sections.

Example with requested additional sentence segmentation of the paragraph with bounding box coordinates of the sentence structures:

```console
curl -v --form input=@./0thefile.pdf  --form segmentSentences=1 --form teiCoordinates=s localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument
```

Example for processing a given PDF from page 3 (included) to the last page (page 1 and 2 will be ignored, by convention the index of the first page of a PDF is `1`):

```console
curl -v --form input=@./thefile.pdf --form start=3 localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument
```

#### /api/processReferences

Extract and convert all the bibliographical references present in the input document into TEI XML or [BibTeX] format.

#### Debug raw labelling output

The `debugMode` parameter on `/api/processFulltextDocument`, `/api/processFulltextAssetDocument`, `/api/processHeaderDocument` and `/api/processReferences` switches the response from the structured TEI/BibTeX/ZIP output to a `text/plain` dump of the raw CRF / sequence-labelling output of each model invoked during processing. This is intended for development and debugging — for example, to inspect what each model emitted before downstream parsing transformed it.

Each section in the dump corresponds to one model invocation:

```
=== model: segmentation ===
<token>\t<feature 1>\t<feature 2>\t…\t<predicted label>
…

=== model: header ===
…

=== model: name-citation (occurrence 1 of 12) ===
…
```

Each line is one token followed by tab-separated features and ending with the predicted CRF label. Sections for models that are invoked multiple times in a single request (e.g. `name-citation` and `date`, run once per citation name string and per parsed date respectively) are emitted in invocation order, each with a `(occurrence i of n)` suffix. Note that the `citation` model is *not* one of these: all citation strings of a request are labelled together in a single batched sequence, so `citation` appears as a single section rather than once per reference. The response is `text/plain; charset=UTF-8` regardless of the endpoint's normal media type, and overrides the TEI / BibTeX / ZIP body completely.

The models captured are:

| key                       | description                                                                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `segmentation`            | top-level page segmentation (header, body, references, …)                            |
| `header`                  | header zone parsing (title, authors, abstract, …)                                    |
| `fulltext`                | body zone parsing (sections, paragraphs, figure/table refs)                          |
| `reference-segmenter`     | splits the reference block into individual citation strings                          |
| `citation`                | parses each citation string into a structured BiblioItem                             |
| `affiliation-address`     | parses each affiliation block extracted from the header                              |
| `name-header`             | parses each header author/editor name string                                         |
| `name-citation`           | parses each citation author/editor name string                                       |
| `date`                    | normalises each header date and citation publication date                            |
| `figure`                  | per-figure block parsing driven by the `fulltext` output                             |
| `table`                   | per-table block parsing driven by the `fulltext` output                              |
| `funding-acknowledgement` | parses the funding/acknowledgement section when present                              |

The `models` parameter — a comma-separated list of canonical model names — restricts the response to a subset of these. The full pipeline still runs (cascaded models depend on upstream output), so `models` is purely a response filter. Unknown names cause a `400 Bad Request`.

> **Note:** the dump format is the raw CRF tagger output and tracks the underlying feature-vector schema of each model, so it is **not guaranteed stable across GROBID releases**.

Examples:

```console
curl -v --form input=@./thefile.pdf --form debugMode=true localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument
```

```console
curl -v --form input=@./thefile.pdf --form debugMode=true --form models=segmentation,header localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument
```

A `503` error with the default parallel mode normally means that all the threads available to GROBID are currently used. The client need to re-send the query after a wait time that will allow the server to free some threads. The wait time depends on the service and the capacities of the server, we suggest 1 second for the `processDate` service.

You can test this service with the **cURL** command lines, for instance parsing of a raw date string:

```console
curl -X POST -d "date=September 16th, 2001" localhost:8070/api/processDate
```

which will return:

```xml
<date when="2001-9-16" />
```

#### /api/processHeaderNames

|         500          |     Indicate an internal service error, further described by a provided message           |
|         503          |     The service is not available, which usually means that all the threads are currently used                       |

A `503` error with the default parallel mode normally means that all the threads available to GROBID are currently used. The client need to re-send the query after a wait time that will allow the server to free some threads. The wait time depends on the service and the capacities of the server, we suggest 1 second for the `processHeaderNames` service.

You can test this service with the **cURL** command lines, for instance parsing of a raw sequence of header names string:

```console
curl -X POST -d "names=John Doe and Jane Smith" localhost:8070/api/processHeaderNames
```

which will return:

```xml
<persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
  <forename type="first">John</forename>
  <surname>Doe</surname>
</persName>
<persName xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">
  <forename type="first">Jane</forename>
  <surname>Smith</surname>
</persName>
```

A `503` error with the default parallel mode normally means that all the threads available to GROBID are currently used. The client need to re-send the query after a wait time that will allow the server to free some threads. The wait time depends on the service and the capacities of the server, we suggest 1 second for the `processCitationList` service.


### PDF annotation services

#### /api/referenceAnnotations

Return JSON annotations with coordinates in the PDF to be processed, relative to the reference information: reference callouts with links to the full bibliographical reference and bibliographical reference with possible external URL.

As the annotations are provided for dynamic display on top a PDF rendered in javascript, no PDF is harmed during these processes !

For information about how the coordinates are provided, see [Coordinates of structures in the original PDF](Coordinates-in-PDF.md).

|  method   |  request type         |  response type     |  parameters            |  requirement  |  description  |

A `503` error with the default parallel mode normally means that all the threads available to GROBID are currently used. The client need to re-send the query after a wait time that will allow the server to free some threads. The wait time depends on the service and the capacities of the server, we suggest 3-6 seconds for the `referenceAnnotations` service.

#### /api/annotatePDF

Return the PDF augmented with PDF annotations relative to the reference information: reference callouts with links to the full bibliographical reference and bibliographical reference with possible external URL.

Note that this service modify the original PDF, and thus be careful with legal right and reusability of such augmented PDF! For this reason, this service is proposed for experimental purposes and might be deprecated in future version of GROBID, in favor of the above `/api/referenceAnnotations` service.

|  method   |  request type         |  response type     |  parameters            |  requirement  |  description  |

A `503` error with the default parallel mode normally means that all the threads available to GROBID are currently used. The client need to re-send the query after a wait time that will allow the server to free some threads. The wait time depends on the service and the capacities of the server, we suggest 5-10 seconds for the `annotatePDF` service.

### Citation extraction and normalization from patents

#### /api/processCitationPatentTXT

Extract and parse the patent and non patent citations in the description of a patent publication sent as UTF-8 text. Results are returned as a list of TEI citations.

|  method   |  request type         |  response type     |  parameters            |  requirement  |  description  |
|---        |---                    |---                 |---                     |---            |---            |

|           |                       |                    | `consolidateCitations` | optional      | `consolidateCitations` is a string of value `0` (no consolidation, default value) or `1` (consolidate and inject all extra metadata), or `2` (consolidate the citation and inject DOI only). |
|           |                       |                    | `includeRawCitations`  | optional      | `includeRawCitations` is a boolean value, `0` (default. do not include raw reference string in the result) or `1` (include raw reference string in the result). |

Response status codes:

|     HTTP Status code |   reason                                               |

A `503` error with the default parallel mode normally means that all the threads available to GROBID are currently used. The client need to re-send the query after a wait time that will allow the server to free some threads. The wait time depends on the capacities of the server and the size of the input string, we suggest 5-10 seconds for the `processCitationPatentTXT` service.

You can test this service with the **cURL** command lines, for instance parsing of a raw bibliographical reference string in isolation without consolidation (default value):

```console
curl -X POST -d "input=In EP0123456B1 nothing interesting." localhost:8070/api/processCitationPatentTXT
```

which will return:

|           |                       |                    | `consolidateCitations` | optional      | `consolidateCitations` is a string of value `0` (no consolidation, default value) or `1` (consolidate and inject all extra metadata), or `2` (consolidate the citation and inject DOI only). |
|           |                       |                    | `includeRawCitations`  | optional      | for non patent citations, `includeRawCitations` is a boolean value, `0` (default. do not include raw reference string in the result) or `1` (include raw reference string in the result). |

Response status codes:

A `503` error with the default parallel mode normally means that all the threads available to GROBID are currently used. The client need to re-send the query after a wait time that will allow the server to free some threads. The wait time depends on the capacities of the server and the size of the input document, we suggest 5-10 seconds for the `processCitationPatentST36` service.

For non patent citations, it is possible to include the original raw reference string in the parsed result with the parameter `includeRawCitations` set to `1`, for instance:

```console
curl --form input=@/home/lopez/grobid/grobid-core/src/test/resources/s/006271747.xml --form includeRawCitations=1 localhost:8070/api/processCitationPatentST36

#### /api/processCitationPatentPDF

Extract and parse the patent and non patent citations in the description of a patent publication sent as PDF. Results are returned as a list of TEI citations. Note that the text layer must be available in the PDF to be processed (which is, surprisingly in this century, very rarely the case with the PDF available from the main patent offices - however the patent publications that can be downloaded from Google Patents for instance have been processed by a good quality OCR).

#### /api/citationPatentAnnotations

This service is similar to `/api/referenceAnnotations` but for a patent document in PDF. JSON annotations relative the the input PDF are returned with coordinates as described in the page [Coordinates of structures in the original PDF](Coordinates-in-PDF.md).

Patent and non patent citations can be directly visualised on the PDF layout as illustrated by the GROBID console. For patent citations, the provided external reference information are based on the patent number normalisation and relies on Espacenet, the patent access application from the European Patent office. For non patent citation, the external references are similar as for a scientific article (CorssRef DOI link or arXiv.org if an arXiv ID is present).

### Training web API

The following web services can be used to launch the training of a particular model (`/api/modelTraining`), monitor training advancement (`/api/trainingResult`), list ongoing training tokens (`/api/allTraining`), interrupt a training (`/api/killTraining`) and retrieve a model (`/api/model`).

#### /api/modelTraining

Launch a training for a given model. The service return back a training token (as a string) to be used to follow the advancement of the training and eventually get back the associated evaluation.

Only one training per model can run at a time: if a training for the same model is already in progress, the request is rejected with a `409 Conflict`. A different model (or a different flavor, e.g. `header` and `header-light`) can still be trained concurrently.

|   method  |  request type       | response type        |  parameters  | requirement   |   description             |
|---        |---                  |---                   |---           |---            |---                        |
| POST | application/x-www-form-urlencoded |  application/json |   model      |   required    | name of the model to train  |
|           |                     |                      | architecture | optional | name of the architecture to use for training the model, possible values are `CRF` (default), `BiLSTM-CRF`, `BiLSMT-CRF-ELMo` |
|           |                     |                      | type | optional | type of training, `full`, `holdout`, `split`, `nfold`, default is `split` |
|           |                     |                      | ratio | optional | only considered for `split` training mode, give the ratio (number between 0 and 1) of training and evaluation data when splitting the annotated data, default is `0.9` |
|           |                     |                      | n | optional | only considered for `nfold` training mode, give the number of folds to be used, default is `10` |
|           |                     |                      | `incremental` | optional | boolean indicating if the training should be incremental (`1`) starting from the existing model, or not (default, `0`) |

The `type` of training indicates which training and evaluation mode should be used:
- `full`: the whole available training data is used for training a model
- `holdout`: train and use a fixed evaluation set for evaluation, present on the server under `grobid-trainer/resources/dataset/[model]/evaluation/` where `model` is the model indicate by the service parameters `model`
- `split` (default): randomly split the available annotated data into a training and an evaluation set, following the provided ratio (default is 90% for training, 10% for evaluation)
- `nfold`: n-fold cross-evaluation based on the available annotated data (default is 10-fold)

|         409          |     A training for the same model is already in progress.  |
|         500          |     Indicate an internal service error, further described by a provided message           |


You can test this service with the **cURL** command lines, for instance starting the training of the CRF date model and producing an evaluation based on an holdout set:
```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "model=date" -d "type=holdout" localhost:8070/api/modelTraining
```

#### /api/trainingResult

Given a training token delivered by the service `modelTraining`, this service gives the possibility of following the advancement of the training and eventually get back the associated evaluation. Depending on the state of the training, the service will returns:

- if the training is ongoing, an indication of advancement as a string
- it the training is completed, evaluation statistics depending on the selected type of training

|         500          |     Indicate an internal service error, further described by a provided message           |

Example for a training associated to the token `Fq2WYPw5M6`:
```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "token=Fq2WYPw5M6" localhost:8070/api/trainingResult
```

#### /api/allTraining

List the tokens of the trainings currently running in this server instance. The list reflects live,
in-memory state, so after a server restart it is empty (a training runs in-process and does not
survive a restart) even if a `status` file was left as `ongoing` on disk.

|         500          |     Indicate an internal service error, further described by a provided message           |

Example:
```bash
curl -v localhost:8070/api/allTraining
```

#### /api/killTraining

Interrupt a training process corresponding to a token. If the token is still marked `ongoing`, its status is set to `killed`.

> **Note:** `killTraining` interrupts the JVM thread. Native training processes (Wapiti, DeLFT) may
> ignore thread interruption and continue running in the background; the `killed` status is therefore
> optimistic for native-process back-ends.

You can test this service with the **cURL** command lines, for instance retrieving the zipped CRF date model binaries with a POST query:
```bash
curl -v -X POST -d "model=date" "architecture=crf" localhost:8070/api/model > model.zip
```

or with a GET query:

```bash
curl -v -X GET localhost:8070/api/model?model=date > model.zip
```

#### Generate training data

Generate the training data for the grobid models for a PDF document provided in input.
The service will return a ZIP archive with the training data in TEI XML format which may need to be corrected, because it can be used.

| 500                   | Indicate an internal service error, further described by a provided message             |

You can test this service with the **cURL** command lines, for instance creating training data from a PDF document:
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8070/api/createTraining' \
--form 'input=@"PATH_DOCUMENT"' \
--output output_name.zip
```

With a specific flavor (see [dedicated page](Grobid-specialized-processes.md) for available flavor names):
```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8070/api/createTraining' \
--form 'input=@"PATH_DOCUMENT"' \
--form 'flavor=article/light-ref' \
--output output_name.zip
```

The zip file will contain the training data as described in the [general principles](training/General-principles.md) of GROBID training data.

## Parallel mode

The Grobid REST API provides a very efficient way to use the library out of the box, because the service exploits multithreading.

As Grobid is thread-safe and manages a pool of parser instances, it is advised to use several threads to call the REST service for scaling the processing to large collections of documents. This improves considerably the performance of the services for PDF processing because documents can be processed while other are uploading.

Setting the maximum number of parallel processing is done in the GROBID configuration file `grobid-home/config/grobid.yaml`. Adjust this number (default `10`) following the number of cores/threads available on your server:

```yaml
grobid:
  # maximum concurrency allowed to GROBID server for processing parallel requests - change it according to your CPU/GPU capacities
  # for a production server running only GROBID, set the value slightly above the available number of threads of the server
  # to get best performance and security
  concurrency: 10
```

The threads in GROBID service are managed as a pool. When processing a document, the service will request a thread from this pool, and release it to the pool after completion of the request. If all the threads present in the pool are used, it is possible to set the maximum amount of time (in seconds) the request for a thread will wait before considering that no thread will be available and return a http code `503` to the client:

```yaml
grobid:
  # when the pool is full, for queries waiting for the availability of a Grobid engine, this is the maximum time wait to try
  # to get an engine (in seconds) - normally never change it
  poolMaxWait: 1
```

When scaling the service, we think that it is better to maintain this value low (e.g. 1 second) to avoid putting too many open requests on the server.
